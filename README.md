## Hi there 🎀

I’m Zahra Salou, a computer science student in Nantes, France.

I design and build digital experiences, mixing creativity with code.

If an idea sparks, I sketch it, code it, and bring it to life—whether it’s a web project, a UML diagram, or even a webtoon!

My current stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, Kotlin, GoLang (and always learning more).

Favorite tools: Figma, IbisPaint, and my trusty IPad for brainstorming.

I’ve worked on projects during my BecomTech training and my BUT studies, but my favorite so far is the GoLang Game.

Fun Facts:

- I have a cat named Cosmos 🐱
- I hate fizzy drinks (water or fresh juice, please!)
- I’m writing a webtoon in my free time
- Hobbies: drawing, gaming, gym, and Formula 1
